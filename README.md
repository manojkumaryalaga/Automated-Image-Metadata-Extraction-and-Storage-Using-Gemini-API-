# üìÅ PROJECT - PHOTO STORAGE APPLICATION

## Introduction

This course project involves developing, deploying, and enhancing a web application using Google Cloud Run. The web application of the deployed Cloud Run service enables users to upload images, which are then stored in a Google Cloud Storage bucket. Upon each upload, the Gemini API is invoked to generate a JSON file containing a title and description for the uploaded image. This JSON file, named to match the uploaded image, is stored in the same bucket.

The application provides a user-friendly interface where images are displayed as clickable links, each linking to the respective image along with its generated metadata (title and description).

Building upon this foundation, the project further explores automated deployment and revision management within the Cloud Run environment. The existing Cloud Run service is integrated with GitHub, enabling continuous deployment. Every time changes are pushed to the GitHub repository, a new revision is automatically deployed in the Revisions section of the existing Cloud Run service. Traffic is set to 100% for the latest deployed revision, ensuring that all users are served the most up-to-date version of the application.

This automation streamlines development and ensures efficient, hands-free updates to the live application.

## üéØ Goals and Objectives

- ‚úÖ Deploy a scalable and user-friendly web application using Google Cloud Run.
- ‚úÖ Enable users to upload images through the web application.
- ‚úÖ Store uploaded images securely in Google Cloud Storage.
- ‚úÖ Integrate the Gemini API to generate metadata (title and description) for each image and store it as a JSON file.
- ‚úÖ Display uploaded images as clickable links for easy access and viewing.
- ‚úÖ Ensure that clicking on an image shows both the image and its associated metadata.
- ‚úÖ Implement a deployment process using Cloud Run's revision and traffic management.
- ‚úÖ Set traffic to 100% for the latest revision to ensure users always access the newest version.
- ‚úÖ Automate deployment so that any GitHub push triggers an auto-deploy to Cloud Run.

## Implemented Features

- Image upload functionality: Users can select and upload images through a file upload interface.

- Cloud Storage integration: Uploaded images are securely stored in a Google Cloud Storage bucket.

- Gemini API integration: For each uploaded image, the Gemini API generates a title and description, which are stored as a JSON file in the same bucket with the same name as the image.

- Image display and interaction: Uploaded images are shown as clickable links. Clicking on a link opens the image along with its generated metadata (title and description).

- Scalable deployment: The application is deployed on Google Cloud Run, allowing it to scale automatically based on traffic, ensuring high availability and performance.

- Automated deployment: Any changes made to the GitHub repository are automatically deployed to the Cloud Run service. When a commit is pushed, a new revision is created and deployed without the need for manual steps, ensuring the application stays updated.

- Traffic management: The traffic is set to 100% for the latest deployed revision, ensuring that all users access the most up-to-date version of the application.

- Revision management: Google Cloud Run creates a new revision each time a change is committed to the integrated GitHub repository. The service automatically updates to the latest revision, maintaining the most current version of the application in production.
