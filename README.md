# üìÅ PROJECT - PHOTO STORAGE APPLICATION

## Introduction

This course project involves developing, deploying, and enhancing a web application using Google Cloud Run. The web application of the deployed Cloud Run service enables users to upload images, which are then stored in a Google Cloud Storage bucket. Upon each upload, the Gemini API is invoked to generate a JSON file containing a title and description for the uploaded image. This JSON file, named to match the uploaded image, is stored in the same bucket.

The application provides a user-friendly interface where images are displayed as clickable links, each linking to the respective image along with its generated metadata (title and description).

Building upon this foundation, the project further explores automated deployment and revision management within the Cloud Run environment. The existing Cloud Run service is integrated with GitHub, enabling continuous deployment. Every time changes are pushed to the GitHub repository, a new revision is automatically deployed in the Revisions section of the existing Cloud Run service. Traffic is set to 100% for the latest deployed revision, ensuring that all users are served the most up-to-date version of the application.

This automation streamlines development and ensures efficient, hands-free updates to the live application.

## üîÑ Application Workflow (Component-Wise Explanation)

### üßë‚Äçüíª Users ‚Üí Cloud Run: Upload Images
Users interact with the web application to upload images through a simple interface.  
**Importance:** This is the starting point of the workflow. Without user-uploaded images, no processing can begin.

---

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Run ‚Üí Google Cloud Storage (Bucket): Store Images and Metadata
Cloud Run stores uploaded images in Google Cloud Storage. Metadata (title and description from Gemini API) is stored as a JSON file alongside the image.  
**Importance:** Centralized and scalable storage solution for both files and metadata.

---

### ü§ñ Cloud Run ‚Üí Gemini API: Request Metadata Generation
Cloud Run sends the image to Gemini API to generate AI-based title and description.  
**Importance:** Adds contextual information to each image, improving user experience and searchability.

---

### üîÅ Gemini API ‚Üí Cloud Run: Return Metadata
Gemini returns the generated metadata (title + description) back to Cloud Run.  
**Importance:** This metadata is stored in GCS to complete the upload cycle with content and context.

---

### üîê Cloud Run ‚Üí IAM: Grant Permissions to GCS and Gemini API
IAM policies allow Cloud Run to interact with both GCS and Gemini API.  
**Importance:** Security and authorization. Without these, the application cannot function.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è GitHub ‚Üí Cloud Run: Auto-Deploy on Push
Code pushed to GitHub auto-triggers a deployment to Cloud Run.  
**Importance:** Ensures the app is always live with the latest changes and enables CI/CD.

---

### üì¶ Cloud Run ‚Üí New Revision: Deploy Updates
Every deployment creates a new revision in Cloud Run.  
**Importance:** Enables versioning, rollbacks, and stability during updates.

---

### üö¶ Latest Revision ‚Üí Traffic Management
Cloud Run routes 100% of user traffic to the latest deployed revision.  
**Importance:** Ensures users always access the most updated version of the application.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Breakdown

### 1. Users (Interacting with the App)
**Frontend:** HTML form to upload images via `/` endpoint.  
**Uploads:** Supports JPEG and PNG files.  
- **POST request** uploads the image.
- **GET request** lets users view the image + metadata.
- Endpoint `/files/<filename>` serves metadata from JSON.

**How it works:**  
- User uploads ‚Üí backend sends to GCS ‚Üí Gemini generates metadata ‚Üí app fetches metadata + displays it.

---

### 2. Cloud Run (Deployment Platform)
**Framework:** Flask App  
**Port:** 8080 (default for Cloud Run)  
**Deployment:** Cloud Run handles auto-scaling, traffic routing, HTTPS access.  
**No firewall config needed.**  
**How it helps:** No manual infrastructure setup, reliable public endpoint, autoscaling.

---

### 3. Google Cloud Storage (Bucket)
**Purpose:** Stores both image files and JSON metadata.  
**Bucket Setup:**  
- Uses environment variable `BUCKET_NAME`  
- Private access by default  
**Storage Logic:**  
- Uploaded image ‚Üí stored as `.jpg` or `.png`  
- Metadata ‚Üí stored as `.json` (same name)

**How it helps:** Links every image to a context-rich JSON file. Fast, durable, and scalable.

---

### 4. Gemini API (Image Metadata Generation)
**Function:** Sends uploaded images to Gemini API to generate a title and description.Gemini API returns a title and description for each uploaded image 
**API Key:** Stored in environment variable `GEMINI_API_KEY`.  
**Example:**  
```python
genai.configure(api_key=os.environ["GEMINI_API_KEY"])
```
---
**Storage:** Parses and saves this metadata as a JSON file in Google Cloud Storage linked to the image.  
**How it helps:** Automatically generates meaningful metadata for every uploaded image.

---
### 5. GitHub Repository  
**Files:** Contains three files needed to deploy the current web application to Cloud Run.

# Pros

- Cloud Run dynamically adjusts to traffic, ensuring the app scales based on the number of requests, especially useful for fluctuating workloads.
- Cloud Run instances are stateless, allowing multiple instances to handle requests concurrently without affecting functionality.
- Google Cloud Storage (GCS) stores images, making them globally accessible to any instance, preventing data loss during scaling.
- Deployment is straightforward using `gcloud run deploy` and can be done directly from the source directory.
- Images and metadata stored in Cloud Storage allow users to access uploaded content seamlessly from any instance.
- The app integrates well with Google services like Cloud Storage and Gemini AI for efficient operations.
- Changes pushed to GitHub trigger automatic deployment to Cloud Run, reducing manual steps and enabling continuous delivery.
- All traffic is routed to the most recent revision, ensuring users experience the latest features and updates.
- Older revisions remain inactive but are retained for rollback if needed, maintaining operational safety.
- The application scales automatically based on incoming traffic, ensuring consistent performance regardless of demand.
- Manual traffic controls allow quick reassignment of traffic to previous revisions if rollback is necessary.

# Cons

- Due to Cloud Run‚Äôs stateless nature, user sessions and context might be lost when requests route between different instances.
- Cold starts can cause delays when new instances spin up after idle periods.
- Distributed handling of requests may cause issues with user session continuity.
- High upload frequency or heavy traffic can lead to throttling or delays accessing Cloud Storage, especially for large files.
- Uploading and processing large images may increase response times and latency.
- The solution lacks built-in user authentication; custom security must be implemented.
- Instances are ephemeral, so any data stored locally is lost on scale down, complicating state management.
- Relying on the latest deployed revision means any bugs affect all users immediately.
- If the latest revision fails, users experience downtime until traffic is manually redirected, possibly degrading user experience.

# Problems Encountered and Solutions

- **Issue:** Gunicorn error "worker spawn failed" and Pillow library not recognized.  
  **Solution:** Used `pip freeze` to verify dependency versions and updated `requirements.txt` accordingly, fixing Pillow version.  

- **Issue:** `main.py` bound to fixed port (5000) incompatible with Cloud Run dynamic ports.  
  **Solution:** Modified `main.py` to bind dynamically to the environment‚Äôs assigned port by using:  
  ```python
  app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=int(os.environ.get("PORT", 8080)))
